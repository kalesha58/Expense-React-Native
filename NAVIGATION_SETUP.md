# Navigation Setup

## Overview

The app now has a proper navigation setup using React Navigation v7. The login button will navigate directly to the Department screen without making any API calls.

## Navigation Flow

1. **App.tsx** - Main app component with providers
2. **AppNavigator.tsx** - Navigation container with stack navigator
3. **LoginScreen** - Login form that navigates to Department screen
4. **DepartmentScreen** - Department selection screen

## How to Test

1. Run the app: `npm run android` or `npm run ios`
2. You'll see the login screen
3. Enter any username and password
4. Click "Log In" button
5. After a 1-second loading delay, you'll be navigated to the Department screen

## Navigation Structure

```
App
├── ThemeProvider
├── AuthProvider
└── AppNavigator
    ├── Login (initial route)
    ├── SelectDepartment
    └── Splash
```

## Key Files

- `App.tsx` - Main app component
- `src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx` - Navigation setup
- `src/utils/NavigationUtils.tsx` - Navigation utilities
- `src/screens/LoginScreen.tsx` - Login screen with navigation
- `src/screens/DepartmentScreen.tsx` - Department selection screen

## Navigation Methods

- `replace('SelectDepartment')` - Replaces current screen with department screen
- `navigate('SelectDepartment')` - Navigates to department screen
- `goBack()` - Goes back to previous screen

## Logging

The app uses a custom logger utility that:
- Logs in development mode only
- Provides structured logging with timestamps
- Can be extended for remote logging in production

## Next Steps

1. Test the navigation flow
2. Add more screens to the navigation stack
3. Implement proper authentication flow
4. Add navigation guards for protected routes
